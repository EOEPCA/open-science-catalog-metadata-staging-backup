  "description": "Selection, out of a pre-defined set of aerosol classes, that best fits an input data set (observed or modeled). The pre-defined set of aerosol classes includes specification of the particle composition, mixing state, complex refractive index, and shape as a function of particle size. The definition of aerosol type includes specification of all the classes as well as the algorithm used to choose the best fit to the input data.",
