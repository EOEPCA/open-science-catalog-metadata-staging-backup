    "description": "North Altantic Total Surface Current, contains the total surface current including CMEMS geostrophy and Ekman+Near-Inertial currents estimated from ERA5-10m winds with an empirically-adjusted 1D - depth model (Ubelmann et al., in prep).\nThis dataset provides Level 4 total current including geostrophy and a data-driven approach for Ekman and near-inertial current, based on a convolution between drifter observation and wind history, to fit empirically a complex and time-lag dependant transfer function between ERA5 wind stress and current.",
