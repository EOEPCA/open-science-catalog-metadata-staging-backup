    "description": "Primary production by marine phytoplankton was modelled using ocean-colour remote sensing products and a spectrally-resolved primary production model that incorporates the vertical structure of phytoplankton and simulates changes in photosynthesis as a function of irradiance using a two-parameter photosynthesis versus irradiance (P-I) function (see Kulk et al. 2020, Sathyendranath et al. 2020a, and references therein for details). Chlorophyll-a products were obtained from the European Space Agency (ESA) Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI v4.2 dataset). Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR) products were obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and were corrected for inter-sensor bias in products. In situ datasets of chlorophyll-a profile parameters and P-I parameters were incorporated as described in Kulk et al. (2020). Data are provided as netCDF files containing global, monthly marine phytoplankton primary production products (in mg C m-2 d-1) for the period of 1998 to 2020 at 9 km spatial resolution.",
