    "title": "Estimation of Stokes Drift Components from WaveWatch3 Model over Global Ocean",
    "description": "This dataset provides surface Stokes drift as retrieved from the wave energy spectrum computed by the spectral wave model WAVEWATCH-III (r), under NOAA license, discretized in wave numbers and directions and the water depth at each location. It is estimated at the sea surface and expressed in m.s-1. WAVEWATCH-III (r) model solves the random phase spectral action density balance equation for wavenumber-direction spectra. Please refer to the WAVEWATCH-III User Manual for fully detailed description of the wave model equations and numerical approaches.",
