    "description": "Hourly stress equivalent wind and wind stress components at 10-m from ERA*, which consists of ECMWF ERA5 output, converted to U10S and stress, and then corrected using several scatterometer data sources.\nThis dataset provides the meridional and zonal components of both the stress-equivalent wind (U10S) and wind stress (Tau) vectors. The ERA* product is a correction of the ECMWF Fifth Reanalysis (ERA5) output by means of geo-located scatterometer-ERA5 differences over a 15-day temporal window. The product also contains ERA5 U10S and Tau.\n\n",
