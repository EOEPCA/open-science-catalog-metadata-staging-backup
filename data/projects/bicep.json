    "description": "The ocean carbon cycle is a vital part of the global carbon cycle. It has been estimated that around a quarter of anthropogenically-produced emissions of CO2, caused from the burning of fossil fuels and land use change, have been absorbed by the ocean. On the other hand, significant advances have been made recently to expand and enhance the quality of a wide range of Remote Sensing based products capturing different aspects of the ocean carbon cycle.\n\nBICEP will bring these developments together to increase understanding of the ocean biological pump and its processes and interactions with the Earth system.\n\nThe main objective of BICEP is to exploit the latest advances in satellite Earth observation, novel in situ data, and new theoretical analyses, to provide the best possible characterization and understanding of the global ocean biological carbon pump, its variability in space and time, and its interactions with the Earth system.",
