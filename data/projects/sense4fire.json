    "description": "Based on the new possibilities of the Sentinel series of satellites, this project aims to develop a highly novel approach to derive global fire emissions estimates based on the characterisation of individual fires and their behaviour. These data will be combined with bottom-up estimates of fuel and combustion and top-down constraints on total carbon emissions and emissions factors. Furthermore, observations of atmospheric composition will be exploited to provide an uncertainty assessment from top-down emission estimation.",
