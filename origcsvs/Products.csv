Active subglacial lakes have been identified throughout Antarctica, offering a window into subglacial environments and their impact on ice sheet mass balance. Here we use high-resolution altimetry measurements from 2010 to 2019 to show that a lake system under the Thwaites Glacier undertook a large episode of activity in 2017, only four years after the system underwent a substantial drainage event. Our observations suggest significant modifications of the drainage system between the two events, with 2017 experiencing greater upstream discharge, faster lake-to-lake connectivity, and the transfer of water within a closed system. Measured rates of lake recharge during the inter-drainage period are 137% larger than modeled estimates, suggesting processes that drive subglacial meltwater production, such as geothermal heat flux or basal friction, are currently underestimated.","https://4d-antarctica.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Malczyk_etal_2020_data_v2.tar","https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL089658",,,Glacier cover,"2010.01.01","2019.12.31","Antarctica","-180,-80,180,-61","2020.09.01","Cryosphere",,,,,,"CryoSat-2; SMOS; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; ERS-1; ERS-2; ENVISAT; AMSR-E; TanDEM-X; Landsat-8"

(2021 a) over the Southern Italy. The specifications of the S-1 SSM product are provided in Balenzano et al. (2021 b). The SSM time series was obtained in correspondence of the ascending (RON A146) S-1 Interferometric Wide swath (IW) acquisition dates from January 2015 to December 2018 with a temporal gap between consecutive of 6 days (when both S-1A and S-1B data are available) or 12 days. On each date (183 in total), two co-registered layers are provided: mean SSM [m3/m3] and its standard deviation [m3/m3], which provides the SSM uncertainty. The retrieval algorithm is a time series short term change detection (STCD) that is implemented in the â€œSoil MOisture retrieval from multi-temporal SAR data (SMOSAR) code (Balenzano et al. 2013).

The occurrence of a sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) can be identified as a rapid increase in the polar temperature (>25 K in a week or less), the reversal of the meridional temperature gradient (T at 90ËšN minus T at 60ËšN) from negative to positive values, and the reduction or reversal of the zonal mean zonal wind in the stratosphere at 60ËšN. An SSW event is called ""major"" when the direction of the zonal mean zonal wind at 60ËšN and 10 hPa changes from eastward to westward; otherwise the event is called ""minor"". The ionospheric variability results not only from SSWs but also from solar and magnetospheric sources. The F10.7 index is a proxy for the solar energetic radiation flux into the Earth's upper atmosphere. The Kp index quantifies geomagnetic activity, which is closely related to the activity level of the magnetosphere. Geomagnetic activity is considered to be high when the daily sum of the Kp index is 23 or more.","https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/section/geomagnetism/projects/archive/vera-vertical-coupling-in-earths-atmosphere-at-mid-and-high-latitudes/#c65013",,,,"Geomagnetic field","2008.01.01","2018.12.31",,,"2021.04.01","Magnetosphere_Ionosphere",,,,,,"SWARM"

We present the first modern Antarctic-wide gravity data compilation derived from 13 million data points covering an area of 10 million km**2, which corresponds to 73% coverage of the continent. The remove-compute-restore technique was applied for gridding, which facilitated leveling of the different gravity data sets with respect to an Earth gravity model derived from satellite data alone. The resulting free-air and Bouguer gravity anomaly grids of 10 km resolution are publicly available. These grids will enable new high-resolution combined Earth gravity models to be derived and represent a major step forward toward solving the geodetic polar data gap problem.

Curie depth estimates were calculated and served as a boundary condition for geothermal modeling. We split the magnetic anomaly grid into windows, with 200x200km and a 300x300km dimensions and apply spectral methods to obtain the curie depth. Depths are calculated using GMT fft tool end errors are standard deviation from fft. The results for the respective window sizes are given in 200km_Dziadek_etal_CurieDepth_Results.csv/.nc and 300km_Dziadek_etal_CurieDepth_Results.csv/.nc. .csv corresponds to xyz data and .nc corresponds to the gridded data in NetCDF format, respectively.

The retrieval for the products is based on Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) extended to the ocean domain (PhytoDOAS). The spectral integrated Kd are derived from the Vibrational Raman Scattering (VRS) signal of the ocean which is retrieved by DOAS fits in three different fit windows. Kd-UVAB corresponds to DOAS VRS fits in the wavelength regions of 349.5 - 382 nm, Kd-UVA to 405 - 450 nm, and Kd-blue to 450 - 493 nm. VRS fit factors in the blue fit window (450 - 493 nm) were offset-corrected (an offset of 0.186 was added to the VRS fit factor of all processed S5P ground pixels). Derived Kd-blue are otherwise unrealistically high. The offset was determined with the help of Kd data at 490 nm from the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3A. Fit results from the DOAS retrieval are converted into physical quantities using look-up-tables which were established with coupled atmosphere-ocean radiative transfer modeling using the software SCIATRAN version 4.0.8 (Rozanov et al. 2017, https://www.iup.uni-bremen.de/sciatran/).

Earth system model TA and DIC (HADGEM2-ES) are also included. Results are compared with in situ (GLODAPv2) TA and DIC and results analysed in five regions (global, Greater Caribbean, Amazon plume, Amazon plume with in situ SSS < 35 and Bay of Bengal). Results are presented in three versions, denoted by 'X' in the lists below: using all available data (X = ''); excluding data with bathymetry < 500m (X = 'Depth500'); excluding data with both bathymetry < 500m and distance from nearest coast < 300 km (X = 'Depth500Dist300').

Datasets S6 to S10 are .csv statistical analyses of the performance of each combination of algorithm and input data - carbonate system variable, algorithm, input datasets used, (MAD, RMSD using all available data, output score, RMSD estimated from output score, output and in situ mean and standard deviation, correlation coefficient), all items in brackets presented both unweighted and weighted, number of matchups, number of potential matchups, matchup coverage, RMSD after subtraction of linear regression, percentage reduction in RMSD due to subtraction of linear regression and weighted score divided by number of matchups). Datasets S11 to S15 are zipped netCDF files containing error analyses of all outputs in each region, including the squared error of each output at each matchup, the weight of each squared error (1/squared uncertainty), weight * squared error, number of matchups available to each output, number of matchups available to each combination of two outputs, (score of each output in a given comparison of two outputs, overall output score and RMSD estimated from output score), all items in the last brackets presented both unweighted and weighted.

For a given variable and region, the first line shows the algorithm, input data sources, estimated RMSD and bias of the output with lowest estimated RMSD. Subsequent lines show the effect of excluding combinations of algorithms and/or inputs, ordered first by the number of algorithms/inputs excluded (fewest first), then by effect on lowest estimated RMSD. So the first line(s) consist of the effects of excluding the best algorithm and each of the input sources to that algorithm, most important first. Each line consists of the item excluded, ratio of resulting estimated RMSD to original estimated RMSD, resulting bias and number of items excluded. Some exclusions are equivalent, for instance exclusion of WOA nitrate (the only nitrate source) is equivalent to excluding all algorithms using nitrate. Dataset S21 contains a comprehensive list of all possible exclusions, and so is rather hard to read and interpret. To mitigate this, Dataset S22 contains only those exclusion sets with effect greater than 1% and at least 0.1% greater than any subset of its exclusions.

Full marine carbonate system, calculated from machine learning estimates of total alkalinity (TA) and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2). The surface-ocean pCO2 presented here is the ensemble mean of 16 two-step clustering-regression machine learning estimates. The ensemble is a combination of eight clustering instances and two regression methods. For the clustering, we use K-means clustering (21 clusters) repeated with different initiations, resulting in slightly different clusters. Two machine learning regression methods are applied to each of these clustering instances. These machine learning methods are feed-forward neural-network (FFNN), and gradient boosted machine using decision trees (GBDT). The average of the ensemble members is used as the final estimate. Further, the standard deviation of the ensemble members is an analog of the uncertainty. The same two-step clustering-regression approach is used to estimate TA. The final estimate is the mean of 16 ensemble members. Each ensemble member has 12 clusters. Support vector regression (SVR) is used as the regression method. Again, the standard deviation of the ensemble members is an analog of the uncertainty. Total alkalinity and pCO2 are then used to solve for the remaining parameters of the marine carbonate system using the PyCO2SYS software. The temperature and salinity products used in this calculation are provided in the file. Phosphate and silicate from the interpolated World Ocean Atlas (2018) product were used.

279,"COMPLETED","Irrigation+","Regional irrigation water use at high-resolution - MURRAY-DARLING basin","sm-based-inversion-approach-murray-darling-irrigation","The products are the first regional-scale and high-resolution (1 and 6 km) irrigation water data sets obtained from remote sensing observations. They cover three major river basins: the Ebro river basin (North-eastern Spain), the Po valley (Northern Italy), and the Murray-Darling basin (South-eastern Australia). The data sets are an outcome of the European Space Agency (ESA) Irrigation+ project (https://esairrigationplus.org/). The irrigation amounts have been estimated through the SM-based (Soil-Moisture-based) inversion approach. The satellite-derived irrigation products referring to the European sites have a spatial resolution of 1 km, and they are retrieved by exploiting Sentinel-1 soil moisture data obtained through the RT1 (first-order Radiative Transfer) model. A spatial sampling of 6 km is instead used for the Australian pilot area, since in this case the soil moisture information comes from CYGNSS (Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System) observations.

280,"COMPLETED","4D-Greenland","Subglacial Melt Maps","subglacial-melt-maps","The raster maps showing the subglacial melt for the Greenland ice sheet is based on the sum of different heat sources. The basal melt rates are spatially distributed and each grid cell represents a potential source of basal meltwater. These maps are produced for each timestamp associated with the surface velocity data maps and surface meltwater volumes. However, the time-varying friction heat component has a large uncertainty due to limitations in the numerical approximation. The “Greenland Ice Sheet Basal Melt”  data set  (Karlsson, 2021) is available as rasters in NETCDF format:
This dataset contains basal melt rates as published in Karlsson et al., (2021). The data can be accessed in three formats NetCDF, ascii and Matlab. The data contain basal melt rates in metres per year from three different heat sources: geothermal flux, friction heat and viscous heat from surface meltwater. The data also contain the total basal melt rates in metres per year (the sum of the three terms). Uncertainties for each term is named X_unc. Note that the geothermal flux has an asymetrical uncertainty. The uncertainty for the total melt rates are found by root squared sum of uncertainties.

The dataset provides a classification of supraglacial lake extent, derived using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, over the Watson case study site. The dataset is produced using a dynamic thresholding approach (Miles et al 2018).
The dataset is produced for the period May 2017- Sept 2019. The temporal resolution of the dataset is approximately fortnightly (subject to methodological limitations) and is delivered as rasters in GeoTIFF format (epsg:3413). Raster pixels are denoted as: 0 where no surface water was detected; 1 where either HH or HV polarisation detected a backscatter signature representative of surface water; 2 where both HH and HV polarisations detected a backscatter signature representative of surface water; or 999 where the signal has been saturated and the output cannot distinguish if the signal is due to melt or other surface characteristics with the same backscattered signature.
The naming convention indicates the original SAR tile used in the analysis and is identified by the sequence of fields described here:
