2,"ONGOING","4D-ANTARCTICA","4D-ANTARCTICA","Despite the key role that hydrology plays on the ice sheet environment, there is still no global hydrological budget for Antarctica. There is currently a lack of global data on supra- and sub-glacial hydrology, and no systems are in place for continuous monitoring of it or its impact on ice dynamics. The overall aim of 4DAntarctica is to advance our understanding of the Antarctic Ice Sheet’s supra and sub-glacial hydrology, its evolution, and its role within the broader ice sheet and ocean systems. We designed our programme of work to address the following specific objectives: Creating and consolidating an unprecedented dataset composed of ice-sheet wide hydrology and lithospheric products, Earth Observation datasets, and state of the art ice-sheet and hydrology models. Improving our understanding of the physical interaction between electromagnetic radiation, the ice sheet, and liquid water. Developing techniques and algorithms to detect surface and basal melting from satellite observations in conjunction with numerical modelling. Applying these new techniques at local sites and across the continental ice sheet to monitor water dynamics and derive new hydrology datasets. Performing a scientific assessment of Antarctic Ice Sheet hydrology and of its role in the current changes the continent is experiencing. Proposing a future roadmap for enhanced observation of Antarctica’s hydrological cycle. To do so, the project will use a large range of Earth Observation missions (e.g. Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, SMOS, CryoSat-2, GOCE, TanDEM-X, AMSR2, Landsat, Icesat-2) coupled with ice-sheet and hydrological models. By the end of this project, the programme of work presented here will lead to a dramatically improved quantification of meltwater in Antarctica, an improved understanding of fluxes across the continent and to the ocean, and an improved understanding of the impact of the hydrological cycle on ice sheet’s mass balance, its basal environment, and its vulnerability to climate change.","http://www.4d-antarctica.org/","https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/4dantarctica/","UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH (GB), CNR-RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR GEO-HYDROLOGICAL PROTECTION â€“ IRPI (IT), DLR â€“ GERMAN AEROSPACE CENTER (DE), EARTHWAVE Ltd (GB), EIDGENÃ–SSISCHE TECHNISCHE HOCHSCHULE ZURICH (ETH ZURICH) (CH), ENVEO â€“ ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH OBSERVATION GMBH (AT), SHEPHERD SPACE LTD.

The high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere have experienced the largest warming over the last decades. The Greenland ice sheet is currently undergoing rapid changes in response to the increased temperatures. Understanding the Greenland ice sheet hydrologyis essential to understand these changes – and how the Greenland ice sheet will contribute to global sea level rise in a future warming climate. In 4DGreenland we will map and quantify both meltwater- , subglacial- and supra-glacial processes, as well as performing an integrated assessment of Greenland’s hydrology based on the results. We will focus our integrated assessment analysis on the time span 2010-present, and generate a Product Portfolio of novel datasets over the whole Greenland ice sheet to characterise the different components of the hydrological system. Thorough validation ofall derived products and scientific results will be carried out. Another outcome of the project will be a scientific roadmap providing recommendations to ESA to further advance the use of EO technology to address the main knowledge gaps and scientific challenges associated with the Greenland hydrology.","https://4dgreenland.eo4cryo.dk/","https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/4dgreenland/","Technical University of Denmark (DTU), GEUS, Lancaster University (LU), Environmental Earth Observation IT GmbH (ENVEO), Finish Meterological Institute (FMI), German Aerospace Center (DLR), Earthwave, Sciences [&] Technology Corporation (S&T), Shepherd SPACE lth",26.08.2020,01.09.2022,"Diego Fernandez","diego.fernandez@esa.int","Cryosphere",,,,,

28,"ONGOING","Biological Pump and Carbon Exchange Processes","BICEP","The ocean carbon cycle is a vital part of the global carbon cycle. It has been estimated that around a quarter of anthropogenically-produced emissions of CO2, caused from the burning of fossil fuels and land use change, have been absorbed by the ocean. On the other hand, significant advances have been made recently to expand and enhance the quality of a wide range of Remote Sensing based products capturing different aspects of the ocean carbon cycle. Building on recommendations made in a series of recent meetings and reports, on ESA lead initiatives and projects and on other relevant international programmes, the objective of the BICEP project is to bring these developments together into an holistic exercise to further advance our capacity to better characterise from a synergetic use of space data, in-situ measurements and model outputs, the different components of the ocean biological carbon pump, its pools and fluxes, its variability in space and time and the understanding of its processes and interactions with the earth system. To achieve this goal, the BICEP project will first synthesise the current state of knowledge in the field and produce a consolidated set of scientific requirements that define the products to be generated, as well as how these products will be evaluated and used to produce an enhanced BICEP dataset. Major emphasis will be placed on developing unified products to ensure that the carbon budgets made are in balance. Uncertainties in the derived products will also be quantified. A large in situ dataset of ocean carbon pools and fluxes will be created, to be used to evaluate and select the algorithms, with a focus on five key test sites, representative of the range of conditions in the global ocean. Using these selected algorithms, a 20-year time series of data will be generated, built through application of the selected algorithms to the ESA OC-CCI time series, a merged, bias-corrected ocean-colour data record explicitly designed for long-term analysis. The dataset will be used as input to a novel, satellite-based characterisation of the ocean biological carbon pump, quantifying the pools and fluxes, how they vary in time and space, and how they compare with ocean model estimates. The satellite-based Ocean Biological Cabon Pump analysis will then be placed in the context of carbon cycling in other domains of the Earth System, through engagement with Earth System modellers and climate scientists. Finally, a workshop will be organized, to be used as a vehicle to engage the international community in a discussion on how the BICEP work could be pushed forward, and integrated with results from other components of the ocean carbon cycle (e.g. CO2 air-flux and ocean acidification) not covered in the project, and how the representation of satellite-based ocean carbon work could be further improved in the context of large international Earth System analysis, such as the Global Carbon Project and assessments made within the International Panel of Climate Change (IPCC). The proposed work will be delivered by a consortium of twelve international Institutes, led by the Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML, Plymouth, UK) and composed of top-level scientists, with collective expertise on Remote Sensing, statistical modelling, ocean carbon cycling, theoretical ecology and Earth System science.","https://bicep-project.org/Home","https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/bicep/","PLYMOUTH MARINE LABORATORY (GB),FINNISH METEOROLOGICAL INSTITUTE (FI),HELLENIC CENTRE FOR MARINE RESEARCH (HCMR) (GR),HYGEOS (FR),NATIONAL AND KAPODISTRIAN UNIVERSIT (GR),UNIVERSITY OF EXETER (GB),UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD (GB)",09.12.2019,31.08.2023,"Marie-Helene Rio","marie-helene.rio@esa.int","Oceans",,,,,

51,"COMPLETED","Impact study of COVID-19 lockdown measures on air quality and climate ICOVAC","ICOVAC","The global crisis due to the pandemic spread of the coronavirus COVID-19 that the humanity is facing since early 2020 led to unprecedented measures taken by different governments worldwide in order to limit as much as possible the number of impacted persons. Those measures include social distancing, banning of people gathering and travels, encouragement for teleworking, closings of schools, universities, restaurants, pubs and non-essential product shops, border closings,… All those measures have been implemented by the individual countries at different moments, depending mostly on the virus outbreak timing in each territory. Italy has been the first European country to be significantly impacted by the virus outbreak and to take lockdown measures in early March 2020. Most of the other European countries had to take similar decisions in the following weeks, almost all countries worldwide are impacted by the COVID-19. All those measures impact significantly the anthropogenic emissions in the atmosphere as they lead to a drastic drop in road and air traffic and a strong reduction of industrial activities in non-essential sectors. On the other hand, other sectors might face increased demands, like domestic heating for example. Satellite measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) tropospheric columns are a direct proxy for anthropogenic emissions. A decrease of the TROPOMI NO2 tropospheric columns in different parts of the world (e.g. China, Po Valley, US) during the respective lockdown periods has been reported in many press articles lately. Besides NO2, other atmospheric species such as CO, glyoxal, CO2,… originate, at least partly, from anthropogenic activity and might be impacted by the taken COVID-19 measures. It will be investigated during this work whether a COVID-19 footprint can be detected in available satellite and ground-based data sets for a number of pollutants. We will attempt to assess the potential impact of the lockdown measures on air quality and climate by deriving updated NOx and CO emissions but also on climate with the analysis of satellite greenhouse gas data products, such as XCO2 columns and/or via the use of the NOx emissions as a proxy to derive fossil fuel CO2 emissions.","https://icovac.aeronomie.be/","https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/icovac/","BELGIAN INSTITUTE OF SPACE AERONOMY (BIRA-IASB) (BE), KNMI (NL),Netherlands Institute for Space Research (NWO-I) (NL),UNIVERSITAET BREMEN (DE)",29.04.2020,30.06.2021,"Christian Retscher","christian.retscher@esa.int","Atmosphere",,,,,

The lockdown also led to an appreciable drop in SO2. Despite the significant decrease in NO2, the O3 exhibited a significant increase, probably, due to the minor NO concentration. At the same time the effect on aerosol emission and loading has not been reported yet widely in the scientific literature, although news and social media stories report spectacular cleaner air due to various lock-downs (e.g. “Himalayas being visible from India for the first time in 30 years”). Furthermore, a possible influence of long-term exposure to small particulate matter on COVID-19 mortality has been reported. In general, aerosol distribution is strongly spatially and temporally inhomogeneous. Therefore, to investigate COVID-19 effect on aerosol the remote sensing measurements with frequent revisiting time and fine spatial resolution may be necessary. In this project we investigate the possibility to exploit PRISMA (PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa, an Italian Space Agency (ASI) hyperspectral mission) fine resolution measurements together with daily S5P/TROPOMI and AERONET measurements for motoring environmental dynamics associated with COVID-19 epidemic appearance and evolution in regional scale.",,"https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/prisma/","GRASP-SAS (FR),CATALYSTS GMBH (AT),CloudFLight (DE),CNR-RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR GEO-HYDROLOGICAL PROTECTION â€š IRPI (IT),Institute of BioEconomy (IBE)-CNR (IT),KNMI (NL)",24.07.2020,16.06.2021,"Christian Retscher","christian.retscher@esa.int","Atmosphere",,,,,

However, satellite observations in the spectral range from approximately 340 to 400 nm are known to have unique sensitivity to elevation and absorption of tropospheric aerosols. Traditionally, this sensitivity is used in many ozone monitoring instruments such as TOMS, GOME-1, SCIAMACHY, OMI and GOME-2 for deriving UV Aerosol Index (UVAI) that provides very valuable qualitative information about aerosol distribution. However, UVAI does not have explicit geophysical quantitative meaning and, therefore, it is not fully appropriate for utilization in validation of aerosol transport models and other climate applications. The reflectivity of the Earth’s surface is an important input parameter for many satellite retrievals of atmospheric composition. Examples are the retrieval of trace gases such as ozone, NO2, BrO, CH2O, H2O, CO2, CO, and CH4, and of cloud information and aerosol optical depth (AOD). Recent developments in atmospheric remote sensing have focused strongly on deriving and implementing angular-dependent surface BRDF information (as opposed to using traditional, non-directional Lambertian surface reflectivity information), and on obtaining this information on a much higher spatial resolution than before. ESA S5P+I AOD/BRDF project is focused on aerosol and surface reflectance characterisation using capabilities of Sentinel-5p (TROPOMI) measurements. One objective of the project is to achieve quantitative characterization of aerosol properties from Sentinel-5p. Specifically, the objective is to develop the algorithm capable to provide Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), i.e. aerosol load in the atmosphere as well as to provide information about absorption and type of the aerosol. Another objective of the RFP/ITT is the development of a product of spectral surface BRDF information from (and for) the TROPOMI instrument.","https://www.grasp-sas.com/projects/aod-brdf_sentinel-5p-innovation/","https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/sentinel-5p-innovation-aod-brdf/","GRASP-SAS (FR)CATALYSTS GMBH (AT),KNMI (NL)",01.07.2019,30.12.2021,"Christian Retscher","christian.retscher@esa.int","Atmosphere",,,,,

Water isotopologues can make a unique contribution for better understanding this coupling. In recent years, water vapour isotopologue observations from satellites have become available from thermal nadir infrared measurements (TES, AIRS, IASI) which are sensitive above the boundary layer and from shortwave-infrared (SWIR) sensors (GOSAT, SCIAMACHY) that provide column averaged concentrations including sensitivity to the boundary layer. Sentinel 5P (S5P) measures SWIR radiance spectra that allow retrieval of water isotopologue columns but with much improved spatial and temporal coverage compared to other SWIR sensors thus promising an unique dataset with larger potential for scientific and operational applications. The aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a prototype dataset from Sentinel 5P for water isotopologues. This will be addressed by a team of experts from University of Leicester, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and University of Bergen bringing together expertise in atmospheric measurement (EO and in-situ), and modelling with scientific end-users. Objectives: During this project we will demonstrate the feasibility of measuring stable water isotopologues for S5P, specifically ratios of HDO/H2O by: Optimizing the retrieval method making use of the University of Leicester Full Physics (UoL-FP) retrieval algorithm. Examining and characterize the retrieval performance by validation of retrieved waterisotopologues against reference data sets (MUSICA NDACC data and TCCON) and satellite data from IASI and GOSAT. Assess the impact of the S5P datasets using two different models for defined regions of interest. The findings and recommendations of this project will be delivered through a scientific roadmap, in order to further develop the methods and their application including a transition to operational activities. This will benefit from the strong links of the team with relevant international activities, projects and initiatives.","https://s5pinnovationh2o-iso.le.ac.uk/","https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/sentinel-5p-innovation-water-vapour-isotopologues-project-h2o-iso/","UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER (GB),KARLSRUHE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (DE),UNIVERSITY OF BERGEN (NO)",02.07.2019,30.12.2021,"Christian Retscher","christian.retscher@esa.int","Atmosphere",,,,,

From the Level 1 brightness temperatures we derive the Level-2 data products, namely surface soil moisture and vegetation optical depth (VOD) (over land) and sea surface salinity (over oceans). SMOS not only contributes towards our understanding of the global water cycle, but also has the potential to improve our understanding of the global carbon cycle. The assimilation of SMOS soil moisture into a carbon assimilation scheme built around a terrestrial biosphere model was found to improve global CO2 flux estimates. Similarly, assimilating SMOS soil moisture and AMSR-E C-band VOD data into an evapotranspiration (ET) model was found to improve ET and root-zone soil moisture estimates over Australia.However, there is still a lack of in-depth understanding of the VOD product, and its potential to monitor vegetation properties and processes has not yet been satisfactorily explored.

Since the beginning of the 20th century, global mean sea level experiences an unabated increase of 1.1-1.9 mm.yr-1 recorded by tide gauges. Based on satellite altimetry and since 1993, global mean sea level rises at a higher rate of 3 mm.yr-1. This higher rate denotes a possible acceleration in this global rise. Actual global mean sea level rise mainly reflects global ocean warming (through thermal expansion of sea water) and land ice melt (from Greenland, Antarctica and mountain glaciers). Monitoring precisely these climate variables is mandatory to better understand processes at work under current global warming and to validate climate models used for projections. The OVALIE project proposes to scientifically investigate and partition the respective contribution of the atmospheric forced variability versus the oceanic intrinsic variability for the sea level observations (satellite data -based on Topex/Poseidon, Jason 1-2-3, ERS1, ERS2, ENVISAT, Altika and GRACE- and in situ measurements â€“based on Argo floats and other in situ measurements).

CISAR is an advanced mathematical method developed by Rayference for the joint retrieval of surface reflectance and atmospheric (cloud and aerosols) properties from observations acquired by space-based imagers.The CISAR algorithm relies on the FASTRE radiative transfer model that describes surface reflectance and atmospheric absorption/scattering processes. The lowest level represents the surface. The lower layer hosts the aerosols. Molecular scattering and absorption are also taking place in that layer which is radiatively coupled with the surface for both the single and the multiple scattering. The upper layer is only subject to molecular absorption.The inversion of the FASTRE model within the CISAR algorithm against satellite observations provides accurate estimates of the surface reflectance field, aerosol or cloud optical thickness and single scattering properties in each processed spectral band. An estimate of the retrieval uncertainty is also provided.As the proposed method retrieved both cloud and aerosol properties with the same retrieval algorithm, no cloud mask is needed to perform the retrieval. Additionally, the same algorithm can be applied over any type of surfaces, including dark or bright surfaces or water bodies.","http://www.circas.eu/","https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/consistent-retrieval-of-cloud-aerosol-surface/","RAYFERENCE SPRL (BE), BROCKMANN CONSULT GMBH (DE)",17.07.2017,02.10.2019,"Simon Pinnock","simon.pinnock@esa.int","Atmosphere",,,,,

Indeed, the ocean’s importance is not only one of climate system stabilization (i.e., reaching the equilibrium state, in response to external radiative forcing), but it is also related to its role as a significant services provider, in what is concerned with both marine ecosystems and blue economy activities. Hence, climate-induced effects in these two ocean-based domains are affected not only by long term changes but also by short-lived extreme events.

Cloud shadow fraction, cloud top height, cloud optical depth, solar zenith and viewing angles, were identified as the metrics being the most important in identifying 3D cloud impacts on NO2 TVCD retrievals. For a solar zenith angle less than about 40° the synthetic data show that the NO2 TVCD bias is typically below 10%. For larger solar zenith angles both synthetic and observational data often show NO2 TVCD bias on the order of tens of %. In 3DCTRL, fast retrieval algorithms for 3D cloudy scenes will be designed. Very promising is a retrieval algorithm based on a linearized one-dimensional radiative transfer model, in which the direct beam and its derivative with respect to the total column are computed in a three-dimensional atmosphere. The performance of new methods for cloud correction will be evaluated against the present operational products and independent measurements. 3DCTRL project has the following main objectives: (a) Generate synthetic reference datasets in which true cloud properties including their 3D structure and vertical distribution are known by means of 3D radiative transfer simulations, realistic synthetic data of cloud properties will be obtained from large-eddy simulation (LES) model (b) Explore ways to improve the handling of realistic clouds in trace gas retrievals, specifically for NO2 (c) Testing and evaluation of improved approaches for cloud correction by application on synthetic and real TROPOMI-S5P data.","https://websites.auth.gr/3dctrl/","https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/3dctrl/","ARISTOTLE UNIV.

Currently, detecting and tracking these events in observational data or model projections relies on human-engineered rules which can be inconsistent and unreliable. To address this, we propose to use deep learning techniques to develop models that can learn from diverse data and alleviate the need for subjective rules, while providing useful additional information such as uncertainty estimates.. To develop these models, we will create a large dataset of expert- and crowd-sourced annotations of extreme weather events, including hurricanes, atmospheric rivers, and blocking events. Such large curated data sets have enabled breakthroughs in many disciplines such as biology and computer vision, and will enable large-scale data-driven research of extremes and their complex behaviour.. We will then develop and evaluate a suite of deep learning models based on the new dataset. These deep learning models will be used to detect and track extreme weather events in climate model output and observational data. We will furthermore demonstrate concrete scientific use-cases of our data set and methods by working with domain experts to conduct novel analyses of these extreme weather events and their impact on the European Union. All data and methods from this project will be made openly accessible and we will provide tools and documentation for simple use of the resulting data and models for further research and education by non-experts and experts alike.

Increasing surface temperatures drive significant changes in the cryosphere, reducing the snow mass and extent, seasonal frost and permafrost. Changes in the cryosphere are interconnected with changes in the biosphere, e.g. carbon uptake and release by vegetation and soil. These cryosphere-biosphere linkages and feedbacks may have important implications for the warming processes in the northern high latitudes and failure to account for them in Earth system models may cause significant uncertainties in climate projections. CryoBioLinks will investigate linkages between cryosphere variables and the carbon uptake of vegetation and their changes by using satellite observations on snow cover, soil freeze, land surface temperature, vegetation indices and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), together with in situ CO2 flux measurements. For that, the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) snow cover fraction, SMOS soil freeze and thaw time series and Sentinel-3 land surface temperature will be exploited and combined. SMOS soil freeze and thaw state will be fused with a novel Sentinel-1 soil freeze and thaw product to improve spatial resolution and reduce scaling errors when compared to CO2 flux sites. The correspondence of advanced vegetation indices from Sentinel-3 (chlorophyll/ carotenoid index and the plant phenological index) and GOSAT SIF and their relationship to gross primary production will be analysed. Satellite proxies describing seasonal dynamics of vegetation photosynthesis and gross primary production will be developed and their spatial distribution will be mapped in the northern high latitudes. The processing of vegetation indices and derived metrics from Sentinel-3 will be implemented to a cloud processing platform. The project will produce and publish multi-annual maps of proxy indicators covering the northern high latitudes (>60°N). Interconnections between the cryosphere variables and carbon fluxes will be studied for different ecosystem types in Finland and underlying mechanisms will be explored with the new terrestrial ecosystem model QUINCY. CryoBioLinks will advance the knowledge and produce new data sets on cryosphere-biosphere interactions, thus contributing to a grand challenge in climate science. The expected indicators can be utilized for the evaluation of cryosphere and biosphere processes in Earth system models.

Accurate representation of HONO sources is highly relevant to the modeling of climate and air quality. However, many uncertainties remain on the formation mechanisms, in part due to the lack of large-scale HONO measurements,consequently, the impact of HONO emissions on tropospheric chemistry remains particularly uncertain although it is believed to be important. Recent global space measurements of HONO in freshly emitted biomass burning plumes using the Sentinel-5Precursor/TROPOMI instrument have provided unprecedented information on the distribution and emissions of this compound, and have opened new research possibilities.

Obtaining consistent models requires combining simultaneously different observable datasets into joint inversions. Among geophysical data, gravity data from ESA’s GOCE satellite mission provides key information in properly constraining the Earth’s density distribution. WINTERCG is a new global thermochemical model of the lithosphere and upper mantle (currently being extended to transition zone) that, among other observables, uses global satellite gravity from GOCE to constrain the model. Its inversion scheme has two main steps. In step 1, 1D inversion is performed using waveform seismic tomographic data and isostasy primarily. Then, in step 2, the output model from step 1 is used as prior information for the inversion of GOCE’s gravity field data for the 3D crustal density and upper mantle composition. As a consequence, the density field changes and modifies the isostatic balance previously achieved in step 1. It originates a residual isostatic topography that can be regarded as a proxy for dynamic topography. However, within a rigorous framework, residual topography and computed dynamic topography (i.e. solving the Stokes equation) should be consistently integrated into a joint inversion with feedback from both the static and dynamic sides. This is currently missing in WINTERC-G and the goal of this project is to add a third step to WINTERC-G global inversion scheme that consistently integrates dynamic topography as an additional model constrain. To do that, we will explicitly compute dynamic topography solving the associated Stokes equation fed by the model 3D distributions of densities and viscosities within the upper mantle and transition zone. Furthermore, the dynamic effects related to mantle convection affect geoid sensitivity kernels; in this project we will also consistently modify the description of the gravity field to include viscosity effects.",,"https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/dygiro/","Universidad  Complutense de Madrid (ES)",10.09.2021,02.10.2023,"Stephen Plummer","stephen.plummer@esa.int","Solid Earth",,,,,

Sea level is predicted to rise drastically by 2100, with significant contribution from the melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet. In these predictions, melt runoff is assumed to contribute directly to sea level change, with little consideration for meltwater storage at the terrestrial margin of the ice sheet. In 2017, 3347 ice marginal lakes were identified in Greenland along the ice margin. Globally, these ice marginal lakes hold up to 0.43 mm of sea level equivalent, which could have a marked impact on future predictions. Therefore, they need to be monitored to understand how changes in ice marginal lake water storage affect melt contribution, and how their dynamics evolve under a changing climate.Currently, there are large challenges in using remote sensing techniques to classify and monitor ice marginal lakes over large regions. Reliance on a single sensor/product (e.g. SAR imagery, optical imagery, DEM products) or detection method (e.g. backscatter classification, spectral indices classification, sink detection)  has proven to reduce the accuracy of lake classification, leading to underestimations and false trends. This emphasises the importance of using compound approaches, which is now achievable with the ever-growing use of online cloud processing.GrIML proposes to examine ice marginal lake changes across Greenland using a multi-sensor and multi-method remote sensing approach to better address their influence on sea level contribution forecasting. Firstly, Greenland-wide inventories of ice marginal lakes will be generated for selected years during the satellite era, building upon established classification methods in a unified cloud processing workflow. Secondly, detailed time-series analysis will be conducted on chosen ice marginal lakes to assess changes in their flooding dynamics; focusing on lakes with societal and scientific importance. The findings from this work will be validated against in-situ observations – namely discharge peaks from downstream outlets, surface turbidity measurements, and terrestrial time-lapse images – to evaluate whether the remote sensing workflow adequately captures ice marginal lake dynamics.",,"https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/griml/","GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF DENMARK AND GREENLAND (DK)",10.11.2021,30.11.2023,"Stephen Plummer","stephen.plummer@esa.int","Cryosphere",,,,,

For these reasons, a thorough understanding of its structure is crucial for both scientific and industrial future activities. In recent years, thanks to the increasing availability of seismic/seismological data and to satellite missions, the Earth crust has been thoroughly investigated and modelled at global and continental scales. However, despite this progress, the crust remains poorly understood in many regions as global models are often too coarse to provide detailed information about the regional and local dynamics. Potential field methods, which exploit gravity and magnetic data, are a powerful tool to recover information on the Earth’s crust structure. A wide variety of gravity and magnetic data in fact have been nowadays collected at near surface altitudes in most regions of the world. These measurements, if properly combined with global satellite data can be used to refine at regional/local scale the modelling of crustal structures, depicting the boundaries between geological units and stratification of the crust. To fully exploit these satellite-derived and terrestrial data ad-hoc physics integrated approaches, to reconcile all the measurements, are required. A promising solution to this issue is represented by the joint processing of both gravity and magnetic fields observations, possibly incorporating the available geological knowledge and constrains coming from seismic acquisitions. In the XORN project an innovative, fully integrated approach will be developed to perform a complete 3D joint inversion of gravity and magnetic fields data, constrained by seismic and geological a-priori information. The developed algorithm will be used within the project to recover a 3D regional model of the Earth crust in the Mediterranean Area in terms of density and magnetic susceptibility distribution and in terms of depths of the main geological horizons.","https://xorn-project.eu/","https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/xorn/","GEOMATICS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IT)CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE (CNRS) (FR)",07.04.2022,19.12.2023,"Ilias Daras","ilias.daras@esa.int","Solid Earth",,,,,

These are the highlights of our proposed activity: The novel algorithm distinguishes itself in several ways from existing approaches:It uses MAX-DOAS sky observations combined with direct sun measurements;It relies on absolute slant columns instead of relative ones; It combines results from UV and VIS spectral regions (Huggins and Chappuis ozone bands respectively) to make use of their different path lengths; It adds the retrieved effective ozone temperature to the input; It analyses entire days as a whole instead of single measurement sequences; It includes temperature profiles from re-analysis to be used in combination with the retrieve effective ozone temperatures. Once validated and made operational, the novel algorithm can be applied to new and existing datasets such as from the Pandonia Global Network (PGN). By this it would be an extremely valuable contribution to our knowledge of tropospheric ozone with direct impact to air quality, tropospheric chemistry and satellite validation. Having a working operational technique to derive TropO3 information from ground-based passive remote sensing measurements would increase our knowledge about TropO3 substantially at hardly any additional cost. Pandoras (or other MAX-DOAS instruments) are distributed in existing networks, e.g. the Pandona Global Network (PGN) with >100 locations around the world and are most often already performing the types of measurements which we plan to use for the algorithm we propose to develop.

158,"ONGOING","HIGH-LATITUDE POYNTING FLUX INTO AND OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE: SWARM, SUPERDARN AND AMPERE OBSERVATIONS (HLPF-SSA)","HLPF-SSA","The Earth’s upper polar atmospheric region is constantly bombarded with energy input from the interaction between the magnetosphere and the solar wind. This controls immediately visible phenomena like the aurora borealis and australis, but also results in changes to the composition and dynamics of the atmosphere itself. The total rate of electromagnetic energy per unit area that travels between the magnetosphere and ionosphere, i.e. between the Earth’s space environment and upper atmosphere, is called the Poynting flux. The Poynting flux can be measured by each satellite in the ESA Swarm constellation. The Poynting flux is one of the most important quantities for space weather studies to accurately determine due to its potential wide-reaching impact on the function of low earth orbiting satellites. This project will include four studies that examine the nature of how Poynting flux is deposited into the ionosphere-thermosphere system, the variability of small-scale Poynting fluxes within larger scale features, and the behaviour of the ionosphere spatially and temporally during uncommon events of upward Poynting flux. It is thought that enhancements of the neutral mass density in the thermospheric cusp region are due to small-scale (<1km) and high-magnitude (several tens of mW/m2) Poynting fluxes in the same region. Previous studies have been unable to fully confirm this, as many instruments lack the ability to measure Poynting fluxes on scales less than a kilometre. The electric field instruments on board the Swarm satellites however have this capability, and so the first study of this proposal will examine statistically the prevalence of sub-kilometre Poynting fluxes, mainly around the dayside cusp region. Whilst Swarm can offer high-resolution measurements of the Poynting flux, it is limited to ionospheric regions overlapping with Swarm orbits. Poynting flux can also be calculated using a combination of data from the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) and the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE). Although the SuperDARN/AMPERE estimation would be global in scale rather than along the track of an orbit, the spatial resolution of both instruments means Poynting flux variability present within larger scale features (like field-aligned and substorm current regions) would be missed. The second study is therefore a multi-instrument study to investigate the small-scale features (measured by Swarm) embedded within large scale ionospheric features (measured by SuperDARN and AMPERE). Finally, both the duration and spatial extent of upward Poynting fluxes will be investigated in studies 3 and 4. When Poynting flux is upward, instead of downward into the atmosphere, it means an ionospheric electric field is driving the magnetosphere rather than the other way around. Upward Poynting flux can be due to the neutral wind flywheel effect, when residual momentum in thermospheric neutrals (from previous geomagnetically active conditions) maintains an ionospheric electric field even though the previous driver (convection of the magnetosphere) stops. This is a seldom studied subject, but the combination of Swarm Poynting flux measurements with the “always-on” global coverage of SuperDARN will offer new insight into how the thermosphere can feedback energy to the magnetosphere.",,"https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/hlpf-ssa/","UNIVERSITY OF SASKATCHEWAN (CA)",15.09.2022,01.04.2024,"Stephen Plummer","stephen.plummer@esa.int","Atmosphere",,,,,

Air quality satellite observations has resolution values good enough to resolve the spatial and temporal variability of trace gases such as NO2 over regions of the world without sources, e.g. the oceans. However they fail in capturing the variability over most landmasses, especially over urban and complex (e.g.mountainous) terrains.

Cloud response to ongoing greenhouse gases climate warming is the largest source of uncertainty for model-based estimates of climate sensitivity and therefore for predicting the evolution of future climate. Understanding the Earth’s energy budget requires knowing the cloud coverage, its vertical distributions and optical properties. Predicting how the Earth climate will evolve requires understanding how these cloud variables respond to climate warming. Documenting how the cloud’s detailed vertical structure evolves on a global scale over the long-term is therefore a necessary step towards understanding and predicting the cloud’s response to climate warming. Satellite observations have been providing a continuous survey of clouds over the whole globe. Passive infrared sounders have been observing our planet since 1979. Active sounders, which measure the altitude-resolved profiles of backscattered radiation with an accuracy on the order of 1−100 meters. These instruments have been providing invaluable information on cloud’s vertical profile with the accuracy matching modern requirements for climate-related processes and feedback analysis since 2006. All active instruments share the same measuring principle – they send a short pulse of laser or radar electromagnetic radiation to the atmosphere, collect the time-resolved backscatter signal by the telescope, and then register it in one or several receiver channels. However, the wavelength, pulse energy, pulse repetition frequency, telescope diameter, orbit, detector, or optical filtering are not the same for any pair of instruments. These differences define the active instruments’ capability of detecting atmospheric aerosols and/or clouds for a given atmospheric situation and observation conditions (day, night, averaging distance). At the same time, there is an obvious need to ensure the continuity of global space-borne lidar measurements. One has to stress that a simple merging of different satellite data is not enough – our overarching goal is to build a multi-lidar record accurate enough to constrain predictions of how the clouds evolve as climate warms. The project will merge the measurements performed by the relatively young space-borne lidar ALADIN/Aeolus, which has been orbiting the Earth since August 2018 and operating at 355nm wavelength with the measurements performed since 2006 by CALIPSO lidar, which is operating at 532nm and is near the end of its lifetime.

The dominant source of global warming is the increase of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the Earth`s atmosphere. atmosphere. The two most important of those species are carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Together they account for ~82% of the anthropogenic radiative forcing. However, uncertainties in our knowledge of the budgets of these gases, which are determined by their sources and sinks, as well as inadequately understood feedback mechanisms, limit the accuracy of current climate change projections from the local to the global scale. To reliably predict the climate of our planet, and to guide political conventions on greenhouse gas avoidance, adequate knowledge of the sources and sinks of these greenhouse gases, their feedbacks, and the quantification of natural versus anthropogenic fluxes is mandatory. Wetland emissions of methane constitute the largest single source of methane to the atmosphere, even when considering all anthropogenic emissions, and are the most uncertain part of the budget. After the tropics, the largest distribution of wetlands is in the Arctic. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as compared to the global average, making climate change’s polar effects more intense than anywhere else in the world.

Ozone (O3) is expected to recover as a consequence of the Montreal Protocol signed in 1987 and its Amendments regulating the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances (ODS). The stratospheric halogen amount (mainly bromine and chlorine) released by ODSs reached its maximum abundance in the middle of the 1990s. Observations from satellites and the ground confirmed that the long-term decline of stratospheric ozone was successfully stopped. Future, stratospheric ozone levels do not only depend on changes in ODS but also on changes in greenhouse gases (GHG) and possibly stratospheric aerosols. The latter modifies both ozone chemistry and dynamics (transport, circulation) of ozone. The rate of ozone recovery thus depends on the geographic region and altitude. In some altitude domains like the lower tropical stratosphere, ozone will likely continue to decline according to the majority of chemistry-climate models. At middle latitudes, the current trends in lower stratospheric ozone remain highly uncertain in part due to larger uncertainties in observational data and larger year-to-year variability in ozone. The major goal of the OREGANO project is to advance our understanding of ozone recovery using a combination of observations and model analyses.

POSEIDON will contribute to advances in Earth system science by addressing some of the major impacts associated with climate change, as outlined by the IPCC and ESA EO Science Strategy. The project will also exploit ESA EO-based missions (CCI, Sentinel-3), as well as deliverables from other ESA-funded projects (BICEP, ESA-S5POC), to deliver a more complete understanding of the impacts of climate change over several areas of the global oceans, providing knowledge for the responsible management of ecosystem services, including phytoplankton production and fisheries.",,"https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/poseidon/","NATIONAL AND KAPODISTRIAN UNIVERSIT (GR)",22.11.2022,15.12.2024,"Stephen Plummer","stephen.plummer@esa.int","Oceans",,,,,
168,"ONGOING","RepreSent","RepreSent","The main objective of the RepreSent project is to capitalize on the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and Earth observation (EO) by exploiting the non-supervised learning paradigms. In this context, it is essential to come up with non-supervised learning-based solutions for impactful use cases that use unlabeled EO data. Firstly, the consortium will investigate the non-supervised learning-based methods for EO, as one of project technical objective. Towards harnessing on the effectiveness of non-supervised learning and exploiting the multitude of unlabeled data, successful feature extractors will be built based on self-supervised learning-based pre-training and transfer learning from pre-trained networks. These techniques are grouped into three main categories: Self-supervised learning for uni-temporal tasks (e.g., Deep Clustering, Contrastive Learning, Bootstrap Your Own Latent, Meta-Learning), Change detection (e.g., Deep change vector analysis, Deep multi-temporal segmentation, Temporal contrastive learning), Time-series anomaly detection (e.g., LSTM based unsupervised approach, Graph neural networks based on a self‑supervised approach). DLR and EPFL will use their AI4EO network and they will establish contacts with other research groups addressing similar or related thematic areas in the AI/EO/NS community. Secondly, the validation of the technical objective will be fulfilled by the consortium by defining five use cases. These use cases are focus on the challenges of EO where either labelled data are scarce or the successful application of supervised methods requires many labels that are tedious or costly to collect. The validation will be done on five use cases related to:  Forest disturbance monitoring, Automated Land Cover mapping, Anomaly detection in long time series of PS-P InSAR, Cloud detection, and removal and Forest biomass estimationnFor these use cases, the required EO data will exploit the openly available Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat archives. The RepreSent EO use cases are tackling core business and scientific questions since they are tightly connected to e-GEOS and VTT core business areas and active projects (InSAR/ground motion and forestry, respectively). This is also ensuring a close link to users and stakeholders in the different sectors where the two partners are very well known. Finally, the non-supervised learning methods developed by the consortium will be evaluated based on usual quantitative performance metrics along with qualitative analyses commenting on their generalization capability and versatility on different EO cases. Each use case proposed within the project will have a user target group. For example, for the use case on forestry, VTT will use the wide community of academic and forestry users including forest owners via the Forestry TEP (F-TEP), while for the use case on anomaly detection, e-GEOS is in contact with several customers interested in the detection of anomalous points.","https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/sipeo/news/article/kick-off-of-the-esa-project-represent/","https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/represent/","DLR - GERMAN AEROSPACE CENTER (DE)E-GEOS (IT),ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE FEDERALE DE LAUSANNE (CH),VTT TECHNICAL RESEARCH CENTRE OF FINLAND LTD (FI)",25.11.2022,20.12.2024,"Bertrand Le Saux","bertrand.le.saux@esa.int","Land","Oceans","Atmosphere",,,
169,"ONGOING","SeasFire: Earth System Deep learning for Seasonal Fire Forecasting in Europe ","SeasFire","The SeasFire project aims to explore and capture potential spatio-temporal asynchronous links happening between pre-occurring and non-overlapping atmospheric conditions and European fire regimes to predict the seasonal burned areas sizes in Europe by leveraging two major advancements of our time: a) the availability of a huge amount of satellite data with a good spatio-temporal resolution, which will be used as fire drivers called the Earth system variables, and b) the progress in Deep Learning (DL) and especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proved capable of capturing the spatio-temporal interactions of the Earth System variables. The project will develop a first-of-its-kind prototype system that predicts the seasonal burned area sizes for Europe, using global environmental variables and terrestrial ecosystem modelling, and simulate their impact on local fire regimes. The project will address the following scientific questions: What is the spatiotemporal contribution of the different fire drivers in the seasonal fire patterns in Europe and how do those fire drivers interact? How much do teleconnections enable us to anticipate seasonal fire patterns with high confidence in comparison to merely climate forecasting strategies? Can we use modern DL architectures to learn memory/lag effects in fire regimes and the possible teleconnections? In this context, the project aims to: Create and publish Global Data Cube with Analysis Ready Data (ARD) that includeGlobal predictor variables related to fire drivers; and the predictand, i.e.  theaggregated burned area sizes. Develop a model showing the predicted burned areas in Europe for the coming fire season and explain the model’s predictions Analyse the SeasFire datacube and use the developed model to Identify the spatiotemporal contribution of the different fire drivers in the seasonal fire patterns in Europe and how those fire drivers interact; detect the contribution of teleconnections and if they enable us to anticipate the seasonal fire patterns with high confidence; Learn memory/lag effects in fire regimes and the possible teleconnections.","https://seasfire.hua.gr/","https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/seasfire/","NATIONAL OBSERVATORY OF ATHENS (GR)HAROKOPIO UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS (GR),MAX PLANCK INSTITUTE FOR BIOGEOCHEMISTRY (DE)",28.09.2021,15.01.2025,"Sveinung Loekken","sveinung.loekken@esa.int","Oceans",,,,,
170,"ONGOING","Synergetic retrieval from multi-mission space-borne measurements for enhancement of aerosol characterization  (SYREMIS)","SYREMIS","In the SYREMIS project we develop the prototyped synergetic retrieval with GRASP algorithm of combined measurements from diverse satellite instruments to bring the accuracy and scope of space-borne aerosol characterization to a new level required for climate studies and air-quality monitoring. In particular, these developments are expected to enhance the accuracy of traditional spectral AOD retrieval and allow the characterization of such aerosol properties as particle size, absorption, and chemical composition. Moreover, the proposed synergetic retrieval is expected to increase essentially the spatial and temporal coverage of the available aerosol product, which is absolutely required to identify aerosol sources and monitor aerosol transport. In this regard, the enhanced synergetic aerosol product is projected to have a significant impact on regional and global climate models (for example, CAMS and MERRA-2 global models). It is also expected to achieve the monitoring of natural or anthropogenic aerosol emissions which is crucial for air quality monitoring. The synergetic retrieval in SYREMIS project is planned to be tested on the currently operating polar-orbiting (TROPOMI/Sentinel-5p, OLCI/Sentinel-3, SLSTR/Sentinel-3) and geostationary (Himawari) satellites. Moreover, the constellation of these multi-mission satellites is expected to be extended in future by the new generation of satellites like Sentinel-5, 3MI/EPS-SG, Sentinel-4, etc. ",,"https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/syremis/","GRASP-SAS (FR)Cloudflight Austria GmbH (AT)",11.11.2022,01.02.2025,"Christian Retscher","christian.retscher@esa.int","Atmosphere",,,,,
171,"ONGOING","Understand and mitigate impacts of 3D clouds on UV-VIS NO2 trace gas retrievals by AI exploration of synthetic and real data (MIT3D)","MIT3D","Operational retrievals of trace gas column amounts assume (near) cloud free conditions.  However, the large pixel size of the satellite instruments (for example the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument on Sentinel 5P, TROPOMI-S5P, is 5.5 km by 3.5 km at nadir) imply  that pixels may be contaminated by sub-pixel sized cloud(s). Furthermore, clouds in neighbour pixels may lead to in-scattering of radiation or cloud shadow effects, both which are three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer effects that may both decrease (cloud shadow) and increase (in-scattering) the retrieved trace gas amount. The goal of the ESA MIT3D project is to understand and mitigate impacts of 3D clouds on UV-VIS NO 2 trace gas retrievals by AI (artifical intelligence) exploration of synthetic and real data. The main objectives of the activity are to: Use AI to find parameters that affect NO2 retrievals using a unique synthetic TROPOMI-S5P data set based on 3D Monte Carlo simulations which includes realistic clouds from large eddy scale simulations. Identify associations between TROPOMI-S5P NO2 and Suomi NPP Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) products using maximal information-based nonparametrix exploration statistics. Improve standard 1D NO2 cloud correction. The MIT3D activity thus aims to reduce errors due to the impact of 3D clouds. The  achievement of the main objectives will be demonstrated by analysis of cloud affected synthetic and real TROPOMI-S5P data and the quantitative comparison of the MIT3D improved NO2 cloud correction  and the standard NO2 cloud correction.",,"https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/mit3d/","NILU - NORWEGIAN INSTITUTE FOR AIR RESEARCH (NO)BELGIAN INSTITUTE OF SPACE AERONOMY (BIRA-IASB) (BE),LUDWIG-MAXIMILIAN UNIVERSITAT MUNCHEN (DE)",16.03.2022,01.04.2025,"Christian Retscher","christian.retscher@esa.int","Atmosphere",,,,,
